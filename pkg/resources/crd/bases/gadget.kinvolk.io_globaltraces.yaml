                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.  4. The fields

                    like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored"
                    or "name must be restricted".     Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded.  3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.  4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity     during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple     and the version of the actual
                    struct is irrelevant.  5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                    this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type     will
                    affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:
                    https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533
                    .'
                  properties:

                      description: 'If referring to a piece of an object instead of
                        an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go
                        field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                        a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                        (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                        (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen
                        only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of
                        an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is
                        subject to change in the future.'
